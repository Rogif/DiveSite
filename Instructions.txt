1. Make the video play and be in an infinite loop.
2. Every sea level needs to have a meter PNG with the name of the level and the animal of this section. This is the order:
   - Sunlight: Turtle
   - Midnight: Octopus
   - Twilight: Angler
   - Abyss: Lanternfish
   - Trenches: Tube
3. The torch:
   a. Add a feather/blur effect around it.
   b. Make it come to 80% opacity at the end instead of 100%.
4. All the animal GIFs and PNGs need to be set on blend mode - overlay and at 35% opacity.
   When triggered by the torch, they should change to blend mode - normal (no blend) and 100% opacity.
   If pressed, it triggers the animal pop-up. If pressed outside or on the pop-up, the pop-up closes.

Thank you bebe, love you <3
